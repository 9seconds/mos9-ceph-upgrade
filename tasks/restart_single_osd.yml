# Wait until all PGs are in the `active+clean' state.
# In Python this check is a clean and simple:
#
# all(pg['state'] == 'active+clean' for pg in json.loads(pg_dump_pre)['pg_stats'])
#
# However ansible expressions are not Python, they are jinja2 templates and
# a naive translation
#
# until: all(pg['state'] == 'active+clean' for pg in (pg_dump_pre|from_json)['pg_stats'])
#
# is not a valid template - `for' is a jinja2 keyword here, not a pythonic one.
# With jinja2 >= 2.8 one could write the condition as
#
# (pg_dump_pre.stdout|from_json)['pg_stats']|rejectattr('state', 'equalto', 'active+clean')|count == 0
#
# however jinja2 2.7 (which is shipped with Ubuntu 14.04) does not provide
# the 'equalto' filter. In order to solve the problem I abuse the `groupby'
# filters to rearrange the pg_stats as a list of dicts (sort of) with keys
# being `grouper' and `list'
#
# (pg_dump_pre.stdout|from_json)['pg_stats']|groupby('state')
#
# [
#  {'grouper': 'active+clean', 'list': [{'pgid': 'foo', ... }, ...]},
#  {'grouper': 'active+degraded', [{'pgid': 'bar', ...}, ...]},
# ]
#
# Let's extract all groupers (states) and join them. The result will be
# 'active+clean' if and only if all states are 'active+clean'. For instance,
# if there some PGs in 'active+degraded' state, and some in the 'active+clean'
# state, the result of join might be 'active+degradedactive+clean' or
# 'active+cleanactive+degraded', neither of thease is equal to 'active+clean'
